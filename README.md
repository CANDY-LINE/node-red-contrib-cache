Memcached-like memory cache Node-RED nodes. You can set/get values and provide them TTL if necessary.

There are 3 nodes in this project.

1. `Cache` configuration node ... Memory cache instance. Each configuration node is isolated from other `Cache` nodes. Default TTL is undefined (never expired). Default check period is undefined (never checked).
1. `Cache in` node ... Used for retrieving a stored value
1. `Cache out` node ... Used for storing a key-value pair. You can set TTL (in seconds) as well as key-value pair by providing TTL property.

The cache behavior is fully depending on [node-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-cache) library. But the project doesn't support full features of the library for making the nodes simpler.

### Installation

```
cd ~/.node-red
npm install --production node-red-contrib-cache
```

### Example flow

You can import an example from the menu (`Import > Examples > cache > Cache Example`) on the editor.
